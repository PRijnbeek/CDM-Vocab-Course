title                : OMOP Common Data Model and Standardized Vocabularies
description          : This course will train you to use the OMOP Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) and its Standardized Vocabularies. Using very simple SQL queries we will help you to better understand the conventions of the CDM and its table structure. We start with an introduction of the OMOP-CDM and will then dive into the Standardize. The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (or OHDSI, pronounced "Odyssey") program is a multi-stakeholder, interdisciplinary collaborative to bring out the value of health data through large-scale analytics. All our solutions are open-source.

OHDSI has established an international network of researchers and observational health databases with a central coordinating center housed at Columbia University.
